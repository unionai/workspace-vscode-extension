# What's Next

Hopefully you've gotten a sense of how easy it is to:

1. Create Union workflows from your existing Python code.
2. Run them locally for debugging and development.
3. Run them on Union Serverless.
4. Iterate on them to make them more robust and scalable.
5. Parallelize and scale them to meet your workload requirements.

## Where do I learn more?

However, we've barely scratched the surface of all the different use cases
that Union supports. Take a look at the following resources to experience
the full power of Union!

- **[ðŸ‘Ÿ Getting Started](https://docs.union.ai/serverless/quick-start)**:
  to get started with Union in your own environment check out this quickstart guide.
- **[ðŸ“– User Guide](https://docs.union.ai/serverless/user-guide)**:
  learn more about the features that make Union super powerful ðŸ’ª, like the built-in [file and directory](https://docs.union.ai/serverless/user-guide/data-input-output/flyte-file-and-flyte-directory#flytefile-and-flytedirectory) types, [Decks](https://docs.union.ai/serverless/api-reference/flytekit-sdk/flyte-deck#flyte-deck), and [dynamic workflows](https://docs.union.ai/serverless/user-guide/core-concepts/workflows/dynamic-workflows#dynamic-workflows).
- **[ðŸ“š Tutorials](https://docs.union.ai/serverless/tutorials/)**:
  check out examples of how to put all of Flyte's constructs together to build end-to-end data and ML workflows, like [video dubbing](https://docs.union.ai/serverless/tutorials/multimodal-ai/video-dubbing), [LLM training](https://docs.union.ai/serverless/tutorials/language-models/liger-kernel-finetuning), and [genomic alignment](https://docs.union.ai/serverless/tutorials/bioinformatics/alignment).


## Write your own workflows

Use this workspace to try creating your own workflows based on what you learn!
Make sure **not to use any sensitive data ðŸ“Š**  or **proprietary code ðŸ’»** in
this environment, and have fun!
