# Inspect the Results

Navigate to the URL produced as the result of running `union run`. This will take you to the Union UI, where you can
see your workflows, tasks, and executions.

There are a few features about Union UI worth noting in this gif:

- The default execution view shows the list of tasks executing in sequential order.
- When you click on a *task* in the execution view, a right-hand panel pops up to display metadata about the task execution, including logs, inputs, outputs, and task metadata.
- Clicking on the **Graph** tab shows the execution graph of the workflow, providing visual information about the topology of the graph and the state of each node as the workflow progresses.
- Clicking on the **Timeline** tab shows the time taken
- On completion, you can inspect the outputs of each task, and ultimately, the overarching workflow.
