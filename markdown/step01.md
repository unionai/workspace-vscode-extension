# Create a Model Training Workflow in Plain Python

[ðŸ“‚ Open Python Workflow](command:flyte-demo.openPyWorkflow)

In this first example, we're going to create a simple model training
workflow in plain Python using the wine dataset and sklearn. As you can see,
we define three functions for getting data, processing data, and training a
model, which we put together into a function called `training_workflow`.

You can run this script locally by [clicking here](command:flyte-demo.openTerminalAndExecute?%7B%22command%22%3A%20%22python%20workflows%2Fpython_workflow.py%22%7D) and running

```python
python workflows/python_workflow.py
```
