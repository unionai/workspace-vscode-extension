# ðŸ¤” Learn More

ðŸŽ‰ Congratulations!

You've successfully run your first Union workflows:

- You trained a model locally and shipped it to Union Serverless with the
  `union run` CLI command.
- You parallelized the training of multiple models to do hyperparameter sweeps
  using `map_task`.
- You ran workflows locally and remotely directly in a Jupyter notebook.

## Next steps

Use this workspace environment to learn more about Union by checking out the
[User Guide](https://docs.union.ai/serverless/user-guide/) and end-to-end
[Tutorial](https://docs.union.ai/serverless/tutorials/) examples.
