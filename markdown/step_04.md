# 🤔 Learn More

🎉 Congratulations!

You've successfully run your first Union workflows:

- You trained a model locally and shipped it to Union Serverless with the
  `union run` CLI command.
- You parallelized the training of multiple models to do hyperparameter sweeps
  using `map_task`.
- You ran workflows locally and remotely directly in a Jupyter notebook.

## Next steps

Use the notebook environment to explore Union further To experience its
full power, check out the following guides:

- 💰 [Reduce compute cost](https://docs.union.ai/serverless/user-guide/core-concepts/caching) by caching workflow outputs.
- 🤫 [Define secrets](https://docs.union.ai/serverless/user-guide/development-cycle/managing-secrets) to keep your data and ML pipelines secure.
- ⏰ [Schedule your workflow](https://docs.union.ai/serverless/user-guide/core-concepts/launch-plans/schedules#schedules) to run on a regular basis.
- 📊 [Create visualizations and reports](https://docs.union.ai/serverless/api-reference/flytekit-sdk/flyte-deck#flyte-deck) with Flyte Decks.
- 🔔 [Add notifications and alerts](https://docs.union.ai/serverless/user-guide/core-concepts/launch-plans/notifications#notifications) to your workflows.
- 🐳 [Define reusable containers](https://docs.union.ai/serverless/user-guide/core-concepts/actors#actors) with `ActorEnvironment`s.
- 📦 [Create `Artifact`s](https://docs.union.ai/serverless/user-guide/core-concepts/artifacts/declaring-artifacts) to persist data and models in Union's artifact registry.
- 🔀 [Trigger workflows](https://docs.union.ai/serverless/user-guide/core-concepts/artifacts/connecting-workflows-with-artifact-event-triggers) from `Artifact` events.
- 🔑 [Create API keys](https://docs.union.ai/serverless/user-guide/development-cycle/managing-apps) for programmatic access to Union Serverless.
